# autoresearch XGBoost

an adaptation of A. Karpathy's [autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) project to XGBoost

The idea: give an AI agent a small but real XGBoost training setup and let it experiment autonomously overnight. It modifies the code, trains, checks if the result improved, keeps or discards, and repeats. You wake up in the morning to a log of experiments and (hopefully) a better model. The training code here is a simplified implementation of XGBoost. The core idea is that you're not touching any of the Python files like you normally would as a researcher. Instead, you are programming the `program.md` markdown files that provide context to the AI agents and set up your autonomous research org. 

## How it works

The repo is deliberately kept small and only really has three files that matter:

- **`prepare.py`** - downloads the data. Not modified by the AI agent.
- **`train.py`** - the single file the agent edits. Contains the XGBoost model training. Everything is fair game that will lead to a model that generalizes on unseen data: data preparation, feature engineering, choosing hyperparameters, and model training. **This file is edited and iterated on by the agent**.
- **`program.md`** - baseline instructions for one agent. Point your agent here and let it go. **This file is edited and iterated on by the human**.
- **`check_groundtruth.py`** - script to check the "ground truth" AUC by the human. AI should not access this file.

## Quick start

```bash

# 1. Install dependencies
pip install pandas xgboost scikit-learn matplotlib --break-system-packages

# 2. Download data
python3 prepare.py

# 3. Manually run a single training experiment (to verify everything works)
python3 train.py
```

If the above commands all work ok, your setup is working and you can go into autonomous research mode.

## Running the agent

Simply spin up your Claude/Codex or whatever you want in this repo (and disable all permissions), then you can prompt something like:

```
Hi have a look at program.md and let's kick off a new experiment! let's do the setup first.
```

The `program.md` file is essentially a super lightweight "skill".

## Project structure

```
prepare.py      - downloads the data
train.py        - XGBoost training (AI agent modifies this)
program.md      - agent instructions
```

## Design choices

- **Single file to modify.** The agent only touches `train.py`. This keeps the scope manageable and diffs reviewable.
- **Self-contained.** No external dependencies beyond XGBoost, pandas, scikit-learn, and polars. No distributed training, no complex configs.
